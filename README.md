🌍 Life Expectancy Prediction Model

This project presents a machine learning model that predicts  Life Expectancy  based on various health, economic, and demographic attributes of different countries. By leveraging data-driven techniques, the model helps uncover patterns and insights that impact life expectancy and can assist policymakers, researchers, and health analysts in decision-making.

🔍 Problem Statement

Predicting life expectancy is a critical task in public health planning. Factors such as immunization coverage, GDP, education, healthcare infrastructure, and mortality rates can significantly influence a population’s average lifespan. This model aims to forecast life expectancy using such features, enabling proactive analysis and strategic policy development.
